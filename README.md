# IPD_Strategy_ML
This project focuses on designing a new strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma using machine learning and behavioral analysis.
Behavioral patterns from existing strategies are analyzed to identify features that lead to high long-term payoffs.
## 💫 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a new optimized strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) using machine learning and behavioral analysis.  
By analyzing historical performance and behavioral patterns of existing strategies, the goal is to construct a hybrid strategy that achieves high long-term payoff.  
The proposed strategy is evaluated through multi-round simulations against well-known IPD strategies.
##📑 Problem Statement(E02)
The problem focuses on designing a robust, adaptive, and interpretable IPD strategy using machine learning insights that maximizes long-term payoffs across diverse opponents.
