# IPD_Strategy_ML
This project focuses on designing a new strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma using machine learning and behavioural analysis. Behavioural patterns from existing strategies are analyzed to identify features that lead to high long-term payoffs.
## Project Overview
The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) is a fundamental problem in game theory that models repeated interactions between rational agents.  
In each round, agents independently choose between cooperation and defection, and receive rewards based on a predefined payoff matrix.  
While short-term selfish behavior may yield immediate gains, long-term interactions require strategies that balance cooperation, retaliation, and forgiveness.
This project aims to design a new IPD strategy by leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze behavioral patterns of existing strategies and identify factors that lead to high long-term payoffs.
