# IPD_Strategy_ML
This project focuses on designing a new strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma using machine learning and behavioral analysis.
Behavioral patterns from existing strategies are analyzed to identify features that lead to high long-term payoffs.
## 💫 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a new optimized strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) using machine learning and behavioral analysis.  
By analyzing historical performance and behavioral patterns of existing strategies, the goal is to construct a hybrid strategy that achieves high long-term payoff.  
The proposed strategy is evaluated through multi-round simulations against well-known IPD strategies.
## 📑 Problem Statement(E02)
The problem focuses on designing a robust, adaptive, and interpretable IPD strategy using machine learning insights that maximizes long-term payoffs across diverse opponents.
### Long Term Strategy Optimization
Designing a strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma requires maximizing cumulative rewards over repeated interactions rather than short-term gains. The challenge lies in creating a strategy that performs consistently well across many rounds.
### Trade-off Between Cooperation and Defection
Pure cooperation leads to exploitation, while constant defection prevents mutual benefit. The problem is to find a balance between cooperative behavior and defensive retaliation.
### Identification of Successful behaviorol patterns
Given multiple known IPD strategies with varying performance, it is difficult to manually identify which behavioral features lead to higher win rates. Data-driven analysis is required to extract these patterns.
### Utilization of Machine Learning for Strategy Design
Traditional rule-based strategies may fail to capture complex interactions. The problem involves using machine learning models to analyze behavioral statistics and guide the creation of an optimized strategy.
